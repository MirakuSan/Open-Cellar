### **MVP**  
*Goal: Solve the core problem of tracking wines and cellars efficiently.*  

1. **Basic Inventory Management**  
   - Add/remove bottles with key details (name, vintage, region, type, quantity).  
   - Assign bottles to multiple cellars (e.g., "Home Cellar," "Summer House").  
   - Manual entry for wine details.  
2. **Simple Drinkability Tracking**  
   - Set "peak drinking window" (start/end dates) per bottle.  
3. **Core Organization**  
   - Filter by cellar, wine type (red/white), and vintage.  
   - Search by keyword (e.g., "Chardonnay").  
5. **(Optional) Data Backup**  
   - Local backup (CSV export/import).
