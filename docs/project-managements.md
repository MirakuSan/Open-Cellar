  - Wine (id, name, producer, vintage, color, quantity, cellar_id, timestamps)
- User authentication system
- RESTful API endpoints:
  - Cellars CRUD (/api/v1/cellars/*)
  - Wines CRUD (/api/v1/cellars/{cellar_id}/wines/*)
- Response format standardization with pagination
- Initial API documentation

### Phase 2 - Core Features
- Complete wine inventory management
- Advanced analytics implementation
- Frontend responsive implementation
- API documentation
